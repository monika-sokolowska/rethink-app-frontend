The ReThink application was developed using React Js and Java Spring Boot technologies. The main goal of the application is to allow users to register their daily carbon footprint associated with various aspects of life such as transportation, diet, and other activities. Additionally, the application enables the calculation and storage of carbon footprints for households, allowing monitoring of the environmental impact of daily activities. Furthermore, the project includes functionality that allows users to share articles related to the environment, carbon footprint, and ecology. A web scraper enables their publication on the application's website after approval by the administrator.
